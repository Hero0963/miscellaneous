 Hello, this is 6mm English ideal and I'm Sun. Sun has a few concepts, the future of food match, where I think in the future I might have a sandwich in about 30-30 minutes in the future. Not quite what I need, with the population of the world increasing along with the net is the effect of climate change and other global issues. We might have radically changed our dance in the future. Oh yes, I have heard about this. There are also several developments from growing artificial means to developing insect-based food. And testing, testing, well, we'll look a little more at this topic shortly, but we start as ever with question and it's a food-based question. In which pandemic did the climate cause originates? Is it a South America, being an Africa? I don't know, I'm going to say Africa, but let's just guess. Okay, well, I will reveal the answer that in this program. Once I'm a recent addition of ABC radio force, the food program there was an interview with Dr. Ma Danyin. Today, she is a future long-known reporter. A future long-known reporter is San Huas, who studies and predicts the way we will be living in the future. Her particular area of response is the subject of food. Her tool thinks the three-state field thinks about a third-foot-futural-futural logister. I think about not just Huas, we are going to be eating in the future and why. But why? Why is that thing? Why is that trend? Why will people start to name mench until that food? That's why of eating less food at that particular time. And when I work for large partners, less hot than one to know, that is the elements of hunch, and mench for thin or disproven hunch. So Huas, the turtle think does she think about? She says less of food future logister. She thinks about what we will be eating in the future and also why we will be eating that food. Yes, in particular, she looks at a, she looks as quite there are particular trends. A trend is Huas, is particular, Huas is popular now or Huas is between popular. So, if then Huas, at the moment there is a trend for eating less wet meat. She also looks as Huas, people, lunch and two particular trends. Two lunch and two clear means to be very interested in something. So if you lunch and two are particular food trends, you start to follow the trend. You might start eating that particular diet. Information about future trends is very important for companies in their food business. How does she actually predict these trends? She says she starts with a hunch. A hunch is a feeling you guess that something is true. You don't have any pure evidence, but your experience and the mind-driven makes you think you might be right. Let's listen again. As a food future logic, I think that Huas will be eating in the future but why? Why is Huas less in? Why is Huas less in? Why will people start eating lunch and two lunch food? But that way of eating that food at that particular time. And Huas, I work for large companies. Let's why then want to know. There is an element of a hunch. But then proofing or disproving that hunch. Data gets goes on to talk about how a subject of food. There are restrictions. Why is that? Well, business of course has different restrictions around it because it's a far-seventy. We are in justiness. The supply chain and the labeling laws are very stringent. It's actually in this country, so it takes longer to ease an idea from just a concept that discuss around a type of tool, actual production, financiality. They bought brand-new, tested, packaged, and put on the shelves. So why do restrictions? Well, it's a vast setting because we are in justiness, which is the way of saying we are putting it into our bodies. It has to be set. It can be a long process of stepping up in a new food and getting into the shafts because of the end to be set and beneath the laws of different countries. In the UK, she mentions that the food safety laws are very stringent. This means that the laws are very tall. So let's hear Dr. Gain again. Food business of course has different restrictions around it because it's a far-seventy. We are in justiness that the supply chain and the labeling laws are very stringent. It's actually in this country, so it takes longer to ease an idea from just a concept of the system. So let's discuss around a type of tool, an actual production, financiality. They bought brand-new, tested, marketed, and put on the shelves. Right. Well, before we review our vocabulary, let's guess the answer to the question. In which content is this tomatoes origin? It is a South America VFC Asian Samphatic food set. I met a guest at the FC. Well I am afraid let's just write, congratulations to everyone who said South America, right let's weekend this was an inspiration. Okay, well we started with the word future logist. This is a non-to-describe someone who started and predicted the way we will be living in the future. Then we had trend. This word can describe what is particular now under the way in which what is popular is the word. For example now we are thinking trend for it in less weight, which means in some parts of the word. If you launch Mantu something, you become interested in this and associated yourself with it. We heard that people then could launch Mantu food trend. Then there was hunch. A hunch is a feeling that about something you think might be true even though you don't have reload evidence for it. Interesting, something is taking it into your body, so eating or thinking it. And finally a string trend rule is a very strict rule. A tough rule or law, which is connection to food is assigned to make sure it is safe and offers strict super ball quality. Okay, thank you Sam. Let's all from 6 million English. Goodbye.
